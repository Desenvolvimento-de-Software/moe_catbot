# Ada Lovelace

This is the TypeScript / Node.js / Express port of a bot for managing Telegram groups.
The main objective of this project is to improve my development practices in TypeScript, while learning to create an application in Node.js / Express.

The name Ada Lovelace was chosen because she was the first programmer in history, as the bot was initially created for a group of software development students.
